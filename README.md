# go-iden3-crypto wasm
*Warning: this is an ongoing experimentation*

WASM wrappers for browser execution of [go-iden3-crypto](https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3-core).

## Wasm usage
To compile to wasm, inside the `wasm` directory, execute:
```
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js go build -o go-iden3-crypto.wasm go-iden3-crypto-wasm-wrappers.go
```

Add the file `wasm_exec.js` in the directory:
```
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" .
```

To see the usage from javascript, check `index.js` file.

Run the http server that allows to load the `.wasm` file:
```
cd webtest && node server.js
```
